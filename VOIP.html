    <h3>What has been the most impactful on our society?</h3>
    <h5>analog, analog-to-digital converter chip, bluetooth,
        codec, GPS, HD, P2P,
        resolution, sampling rate,
        SMS, tethering, VOIP, ISP, </h5>
    <p>
        What I think, due to the pandemic the  is that VoIp has been the most impactful. It may be just because I am
        experiencing the effect of being able to communicate so easily without having to be in the same physical area 
        or even country.
