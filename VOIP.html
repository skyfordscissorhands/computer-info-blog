        I think, the pandemic made us completely reliable on VoIP. VoIP allowed the world
        the ability to communicate easily and allowed the world to continue as best as possible.
<br>
        VoIP changed the way people and businesses communicate. What used to be a hard endeavor to
        properly set up the channels and lines to make conference calls work or business calls is now but a click away.
        Conference calls and video calls are now a standard and no longer an exception to the rule.
<br>
        Think about your average day at work and how much you need to communicate to get the job done. If you use the
        internet to communicate through voice either through Skype, Facebook, Slack, then you utilize the convenience,
        quality, and power of VoIP solutions.
        Outside of basic calls over the phone, something that needs to be discussed in groups, discussed over long
        distances, or shown and explained at the same time can easily be done. This is also combined with the
        convenience of using the computer while using voice to communicate, you can share your screen and have the other
        person follow along, or properly demonstrate or convey a point using visual aids, or simply use the internet and
        do work while talking.
